However I mainly wrote this for my use      to simply start the recording, that way if I forget to start recording on      the camera.&nbsp; I've also found when powering on the solo, it will stop      the recording if you've started it already.&nbsp; Please note that this      comes with no warranty and if after pressing the play button your solo      bursts in to flames and plummets to the ground I am not to be held      accountable.&nbsp; Please test this fully before you fly.</p>    <p>Licensed under the GPLv2</p>    <h2>Install</h2>    <p>This is a command line application to be used with the 3dr Solo.&nbsp; </p>    <ol>      <li>Turn on the 3DR controller and 3DR Solo </li>      <li>Connect to the SoloLink network via Wifi</li>      <li>Copy the ARM binary to /home/root on the Solo.&nbsp; <br>        <pre>scp binaries/linux32/git2Control root@10.1.1.10:~/</pre>      </li>      <li>Create commands for git2Control in solex<br>        <pre><span style="font-family: serif;">/home/root/git2Control -c startCam</span></pre>      </li>    </ol>    <h2>Command Summary</h2>    <p>What git2Control does is search for the camera on the network, then sends      a command to start, stop, recStatus, and takePic.&nbsp; Right now the      number of commands is limited.&nbsp; You can Start the recording, Stop the      recording.&nbsp; To take a picture first start the video capture, then      while you're recording you can take snapshots.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-family: serif;"></span></p>    <pre style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: serif;"></span><spanstyle="font-family: serif;">Commands:	startCam	stopCam	takePic		<br>        recStatus  -c, --cam string           startCam, stopCam, takePic, recStatus.
